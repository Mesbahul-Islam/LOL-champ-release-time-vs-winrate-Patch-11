Comparison of champ release time vs winrate in LOL. 


The results are as I expected. Note that, since the data is from 2021, its normal for the winrate of newly released
champs to be low because it takes a lot of getting used to. The winrate is all time high between 2014 and 2016
and drops later on. Before that, the winrates for the champs are either very low or moderate. This proves that
riot releases broken champs each year which obliterate the game when people start to learn them.
